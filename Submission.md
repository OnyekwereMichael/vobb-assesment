# Vobb Deal Management Dashboard - Submission

## Tech Stack Used

### Core Technologies
- **React 18** with **TypeScript** - Modern React with full type safety
- **Vite** - Fast development and optimized production builds
- **Zustand** - Lightweight state management with persistence
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first styling with custom design system
- **shadcn/ui** - High-quality, accessible UI components

### Key Dependencies
- **@hello-pangea/dnd** - Drag-and-drop functionality for Kanban board
- **React Router DOM** - Client-side routing
- **React Testing Library + Vitest** - Testing framework
- **Lucide React** - Beautiful, consistent icons

## Design Decisions & Trade-offs

### 1. State Management - Zustand vs Redux
**Decision**: Chose Zustand over Redux Toolkit
**Reasoning**: 
- Simpler boilerplate and setup
- Built-in TypeScript support
- Excellent performance with selective subscriptions
- Perfect for medium-complexity applications
- Easy localStorage integration for persistence

### 2. Styling - Tailwind CSS vs Styled Components
**Decision**: Tailwind CSS with custom design system
**Reasoning**:
- Consistent design tokens across the application
- Better performance (no runtime CSS-in-JS)
- Excellent responsive design utilities
- Easy to maintain and scale
- Professional-grade design system implementation

### 3. Drag & Drop - @hello-pangea/dnd vs react-dnd
**Decision**: @hello-pangea/dnd (maintained fork of react-beautiful-dnd)
**Reasoning**:
- Better developer experience and documentation
- Excellent accessibility support
- Smooth animations out of the box
- Active maintenance and React 18 compatibility

### 4. Component Architecture - Composition vs Inheritance
**Decision**: Composition-based component design
**Reasoning**:
- Better reusability and testing
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easy to maintain and extend
- Follows React best practices

### 5. API Architecture - Mock Service vs json-server
**Decision**: Custom mock service with async simulation
**Reasoning**:
- No external dependencies for demo purposes
- Easy to replace with real API
- Realistic async behavior simulation
- Better control over data and error scenarios

## Known Limitations & Areas for Improvement

### Current Limitations

1. **Search & Filtering**: 
   - Search UI is present but not fully functional
   - Filter dropdown needs implementation
   - Could add advanced filtering by stage, date range, value

2. **Real-time Collaboration**:
   - No WebSocket integration for real-time updates
   - Multiple users would need sync mechanisms

3. **Data Pagination**:
   - All data loads at once
   - Would need pagination for large datasets
   - Virtual scrolling for better performance

4. **Offline Support**:
   - No PWA features or offline caching
   - Could implement service workers for offline functionality

5. **Advanced Analytics**:
   - Basic deal counting only
   - Could add charts, conversion rates, performance metrics

### Technical Debt & Improvements

1. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Could implement React.memo for expensive re-renders
   - Virtual scrolling for large deal lists
   - Lazy loading of deal details

2. **Error Handling**:
   - More granular error states
   - Retry mechanisms for failed API calls
   - Better error boundaries

3. **Testing Coverage**:
   - More integration tests for complex workflows
   - E2E tests with Playwright/Cypress
   - Visual regression testing

4. **Accessibility**:
   - Keyboard navigation for drag-and-drop
   - Screen reader optimization
   - High contrast mode support
